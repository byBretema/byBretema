## 👋 Hi there awesome human-being!

I'm Daniel[^1], a Graphics Engineer based on Madrid, Spain.

**I code about:** performance, image processing, 3D rendering, some web applications, and various tools to enhance the development experience.

Check out my highlighted projects below, sorted by category:

**🛠️ Tools**
- [YACPM](https://github.com/byBretema/yacpm) - Helps to simplify external dependencies on a CMake project

**🌊 C++**
- [Vonsai](https://github.com/byBretema/vonsai) - An OpenGL renderer with some abstraction
- [Bretema Engine](https://github.com/byBretema/bretema) - A _WIP_ translation of Vonsai project to Vulkan (right now: **color tools** + **nice camera** + **push_constants**)
- [IMOG - Interactive MOtion Graph](https://github.com/byBretema/imog) - Master Thesis exploring how to create transitions between (_skeletal_) animations

**🌍 Web**
- [Astro + ESLint template](https://github.com/byBretema/astro-eslint-template) - Fast web project initalization with dev tooling ready


[^1]: ***Brétema*** comes from my native language, it means _fog_, and it's one of the first effects you learn in 3D.
