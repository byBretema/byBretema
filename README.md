## Hi there awesome human-being👋

I'm Daniel, a Graphics Engineer based on Madrid, Spain.
> _Brétema_ comes from my native language, and it means fog, and it's one of the first effects you learn in 3D.

I code about: performance, image processing, 3D rendering, some web applications, and various tools to enhance the development experience.
